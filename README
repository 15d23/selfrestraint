About
-----
SelfRestraint is a cross platform version of Steve Lambert's [SelfControl](http://github.com/slambert/selfcontrol), written in Python. It allows you to block distracting sites for a set amount of time, so you can use your computer and access the internet without having to worry about distracting sites.
